## Ondpitch Backend Tech Test

Hello ðŸ‘‹, nice to meet you!


- We are looking at building a mini application (frontend and backend feel free to use your frontend choice but Laravel PHP is important) to give ability for users to:

1. Register themselves (fields could be: firstname, email and password)
2. Ability for users to login (fields could be: email and password)
3. Ability for users to create booking with the following fields (title, user firstname, email and date of booking).
4. Ability for users to see their own (private) bookings. I.e: Bookings by other user A should not be visible to user B
5. An admin interface to see all bookings
6. When a user makes a booking, we need to find a way to send the booking details (title, user firstname and email and date of booking) to the admin email. Admin email can be admin@bookings.com

## Nice to have(s):

It will be good to see some test cases against these functionalities
